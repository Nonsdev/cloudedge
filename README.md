## my first project stored on Git on the last day of march,2023.

### it was deloped with vercel on the production stage.

#### the project included a the use of html(programing language) and css(styling languge).

##### the `html` provided structure for the project while the css sytled and beautified the project.

###### internal styling was used at the initial stage while external styling was used at the end.

#### more css was used and less html at throughout the project.
